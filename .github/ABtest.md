# SafeNest AB Test Ideas:

- Christian Lopez: Group A shall be using a slide out side bar on the left side of the screen to display listings relating to the pinpoints shown on the map. This bar will be scrollable with
information about the location, price, bed and bath count, and an image of the listing. Group B shall be using simply the map with pinpoints for the rental locations, and on tap of the pinpoints
a bottom sheet will be displayed with the same information. This will be done to see whether users prefer a dismissable scrollable side bar or a dismissable bottom sheet for their rental listing
information


- Matthew Barbrack: Group A will be provided with a chip choice widget to allow for users to impliment their preferences for what kind of rental the user is looking for.  Will include all avalible preferences.  Group B will have an filter tab that will be near the address search bar that will be a list of filters and properties that users can add to their search.
The current preferences for both groups will include price range, minimum number of beds/baths, type of residence, house apartment etc, total square footage, etc...
This will be uses the retention metric to see which users prefer to use in the app.


- Kacper Kurowski:To determine which color makes users feel more comfortable, we can implement an A/B test that assigns different color schemes to various user groups and tracks the retention rate for each group. By observing the differences in how long users engage with each version, we can infer which color choice fosters a more welcoming experience. Additionally, weâ€™ll complement this data with a survey that asks users directly about their comfort levels with the interface color, helping us gather qualitative insights.
