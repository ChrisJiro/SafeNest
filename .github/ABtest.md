# SafeNest AB Test Ideas:

- Christian Lopez: Group A shall be using a slide out side bar on the left side of the screen to display listings relating to the pinpoints shown on the map. This bar will be scrollable with
information about the location, price, bed and bath count, and an image of the listing. Group B shall be using simply the map with pinpoints for the rental locations, and on tap of the pinpoints
a bottom sheet will be displayed with the same information. This will be done to see whether users prefer a dismissable scrollable side bar or a dismissable bottom sheet for their rental listing
information
