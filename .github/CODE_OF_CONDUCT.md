# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience

* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

*Attending every meeting that is possible, or being excused with a valid reason and giving 1-2 day notice of not being able to attend. Excuses include: illness, prior responsibilities, family emergencies, transportation issues, tech outages. 

*Meetings will be held in 3 locations, In-Person/In-Class Standups in the beginning of each class, Sprint Review meeting held every 2 weeks on Monday. Discord Call for when we are outside of class and need to correspond and collaborate with each other. Finally, In-Person Emergency meetings will be held in the Library in case there is something we all need to work together.

*Attention is required during all meetings. Therefore, you should not have your phone or any distracting media on your devices, especially during the beginning of the standup meeting where everyone is discussing their BIG 3. Big 3 are what you have done, what problems you had, and what you plan on doing today. Then you are allowed to speak about any feedback you might have with your team developers, which will allow some back-and-forth communication. Finally, we will have an information session about the items in our sprint backlog and discuss future arrangements, then get to work.

*Completing each assignment you have been assigned within each sprint period, please only take as much as you can complete and discuss with other team members if you need to delegate any tasks to your current Sprint Backlog. Failure to complete assignments, or completing them poorly will result in being reassigned the assignment in addition to your work for the next sprint period. If it is still unmet it will result in a strike and you will be moved onto a different assignment, while the rest of the team has to pick up where you left off. If there are tasks that the group doesn’t want to do, we will spin a Wheel of Misfortune of the tasks assigning those first.

*Participating in communication about meetings inside of the discord #meeting-info channel and sharing important information and links in the #resources channel. We will ensure participation by keeping everyone accountable and providing clear communication on what we expect everyone to complete. We want everyone to work on pieces of the project that they are most interested in so that we create the best product we can, early on we will decide pseudo-roles that will help divide us into our specialties so we know what to expect from each other, although we will all be part of the development process equally.

*Promptness is a requirement and we will expect responses back by the end of the night every night on discord. Everyone should be checking their Discord nightly at 9PM to see if any new relevant information is available.

*Conversational Courtesy will be met by giving the active speaker each meeting 5 minutes each during stand-up meetings to discuss what they have gotten done, what problems they encountered and how they fixed it / need help getting fixed, as well as what they plan to do until the next meeting. 

*Agenda planning will happen at the middle of the stand-up meeting after we discuss what we plan on doing, we will confirm that it is in alignment with the current Sprint’s Backlog and if that is empty then we will discuss with our Product Owner what should be included in our next development cycle. We will use The Discord Channel #meeting-info for any notes that we want to share with the team.

*Enforcement of unacceptable behavior will be a 3-Strike System, If you fail to follow guidelines you will given a strike which will be handled locally inside of our team; however, if you reach 3 strikes we will bring up the problems to the Product Owner in which they will guide the Team on further Discipline. Please remember, that you are not only hurting yourself by failing to comply but you are also failing the other team members and ultimately the users.

*Decisions will be made on anonymous polls on discord so that everyone has the time and opportunity to respond before each stand-up meeting, these will take majority lead so we can move quickly. If we have larger decisions to make we will host a zen vote with everyone writing proposals and will involve consensus. 

*Feedback is going to be important to all of us, this will be our final portion of our stand-up meetings so we all know our expectations of each other. If you have anything you do not feel comfortable saying, you can tell the SCRUM Master and they will bring it up during the meeting as their own issue so that you can feel safe having your voice heard.


Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
*Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting
*Failure to complete an assignment without notifying the team that you need help or an extension
*Failure to complete an assignment the second time it was given to you
*Missing more than 1 meeting per week ( this also affects your final grade since our meetings will be in class )
*

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces such as inside of classroom meetings, discord communications, and communication via email..
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement


Instances of Unacceptable behavior will result in a strike, part of our three-strike system:

If you accumulate 3 strikes we will have to take action outside of the scope of our team and include the Product Owner for guidance on disciplinary actions. This may include a reduction in your overall grade contribution of 5%. If any further Disciplinary actions need to be taken that will result in further 2% reduction until reaching 10%. ( Total potential loss is 15% ).

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[kkurowski@uri.edu].
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
